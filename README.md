This project implements a rule based expert system for the board game [Le-Havre](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/35677/le-havre) as part of the Kowledge Engineering course @ uc3m. 

The problem is separated into two files, [ontology.clp](https://github.com/ricardograndecros/Expert-System-for-Le-Havre-board-game/blob/master/ontology.clp) represents the problem's domain, and [rules.clp](https://github.com/ricardograndecros/Expert-System-for-Le-Havre-board-game/blob/master/rules.clp) implements the game's mechanism and the expert's strategy. 

This project solves a simple solution and it's goal is to learn rule-based programming and understand how powerful this tools can be. The [ocumentation available](https://github.com/ricardograndecros/Expert-System-for-Le-Havre-board-game/blob/master/Le-Havre-Doc.pdf) is attached to the project, but it is only available in spanish.
